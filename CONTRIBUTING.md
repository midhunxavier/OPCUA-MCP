# Contributing to OPC UA MCP

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repo provides **two MCP servers**
(Python and TypeScript/Node) that bridge AI assistants to OPC UA servers, plus a
**mock industrial OPC UA server** for local development and testing.

- **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** — how the pieces fit, and the invariants to preserve
- **[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)** — how to test (automated suite, MCP Inspector, AI agents)
- **[docs/examples.md](docs/examples.md)** — per-tool inputs/outputs and node-ID reference

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `packages/mock-server/` | Mock "Industrial Control System" OPC UA server (the simulated PLC/sensors) |
| `packages/server-python/` | **Python** MCP server (FastMCP + `opcua`/FreeOpcUa), a `src/` package |
| `packages/server-node/` | **Node** MCP server (TypeScript + `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + `node-opcua`) |
| `tests/` | End-to-end pytest suite driving both servers via the `mcp` SDK |
| `docs/` | Usage docs (`architecture.md`, `examples.md`, `testing.md`); `archive/` holds executed plans |
| `examples/` | Standalone demo scripts (not part of any package) |

AI assistant / MCP client  ──stdio──►  MCP server (Python OR Node)  ──OPC UA/TCP──►  mock server :4840
```

The two MCP servers share a single tool contract ([`contract/tools.json`](contract/tools.json)): the Node server builds its `tools/list` from it and the Python server reads descriptions and capability node IDs from it, so they cannot drift (`tests/test_contract_parity.py` enforces this).

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm**
- No OPC UA broker needed — the mock server is included.

## Local development

Start the mock server first (it's the data source for everything else):

```bash
uv sync --all-packages          # one-time: set up the workspace env
uv run --no-sync opcua-mock-server
# listens on opc.tcp://0.0.0.0:4840/freeopcua/server/  (history enabled)
```

### Python MCP server
```bash
OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/ \
  uv run --no-sync opcua-mcp-server
```

### Node MCP server
```bash
cd packages/server-node
npm install
npm run build        # compiles src/*.ts -> build/, stages contract + version
OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/ node build/index.js
```

Both servers read the endpoint from `OPCUA_SERVER_URL` (default
`opc.tcp://localhost:4840`). They speak MCP over **stdio**, so keep `stdout`
clean — write all logs to `stderr`.

## Running the tests

Three tiers — use the narrowest one that covers your change:

```bash
uv sync --all-packages                        # one-time workspace setup

cd tests
uv run --no-sync pytest unit/                 # <1s, no server needed
uv run --no-sync pytest                       # unit + e2e (~50s)
uv run --no-sync pytest -m smoke smoke/       # packaged artifacts (~20s)

cd ../packages/server-node
npm run build && npm test                     # Node unit tests
```

The **smoke** tier builds the real npm tarball and Python wheel, installs them in
isolation, and drives the installed entry points. It is the only tier that can
see packaging faults and unbounded dependencies — both of which have shipped
broken releases here before — so run it before any release.

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for details and selectors
(`-k "[python]"` / `-k "[node]"`). For manual testing with the MCP Inspector or an AI
agent, see **[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)**.

## Adding a new MCP tool

The tool surface is defined once in [`contract/tools.json`](contract/tools.json); both servers derive from it, and `tests/test_contract_parity.py` fails if they diverge. To add a tool `foo`:

1. **Contract** (`contract/tools.json`): add an entry under `tools` with its `name`, `description`, `inputSchema` (JSON Schema), and `capability` (`null`, or `"history"`/`"aggregate"` if it depends on a server capability).
2. **Node** (`packages/server-node/src/tools.ts`): add a `case "foo"` to the `callTool` switch and implement the handler method. You do **not** edit `listTools` — it is generated from the contract. Run `npm run build` (this also stages the contract and version into `build/`).
3. **Python** (`packages/server-python/src/opcua_mcp_server/server.py`): add a function decorated with `@mcp.tool(description=_DESC["foo"])`, with typed args (FastMCP derives the input schema from them — keep it matching the contract) and `ctx: Context`. For a capability-gated tool, register it conditionally like `read_history_opcua_node`.
4. **Test**: add an end-to-end test in `tests/e2e/test_mcp_e2e.py` (it runs against both servers). The contract-parity test will automatically check that both servers advertise the new tool with the contract's description and parameters.
5. **Document it** in `docs/examples.md` (the central per-tool reference).

## Code style

Style is enforced by tooling, not by review. CI runs all of the below in a
`lint` job; run them locally before pushing:

```bash
uv run ruff check .            # Python lint  (--fix to autofix)
uv run ruff format .           # Python format
cd packages/server-node
npm run format:check           # Prettier     (npm run format to autofix)
npm run typecheck              # tsc --noEmit
```

Beyond what the tools check:

- **Python**: type-hint tool signatures — FastMCP derives the input schema from
  them, so a wrong annotation is a wire-protocol bug, not a style nit.
- **Never write to `stdout`** except via the MCP transport; stdout carries the
  JSON-RPC stream and stray output corrupts it. Use `print(..., file=sys.stderr)`
  in Python; the Node server already redirects stray `console.log` to `stderr`.
- Broad `except Exception` in a tool handler is intentional and allowed — return
  a readable error to the model rather than tearing down the transport. (This is
  why the `BLE` ruleset is not enabled.)
- Convert/validate inputs explicitly (e.g. date strings → `Date`) and return
  clear error messages.

## Commit & PR conventions

- Branch off `main`; keep commits focused with descriptive messages.
- Run the suite (`uv sync --all-packages`, then `cd tests && uv run --no-sync pytest`) before opening a PR.
- Reference related issues/PRs (e.g. "Fixes #1").
- If a change was AI-assisted, keep the `Co-Authored-By:` trailer.
- PRs from forks: enable **"Allow edits by maintainers"** so reviewers can rebase.

## Security note

The servers connect with `SecurityPolicy.None` / `MessageSecurityMode.None` for
local development. Do **not** use this configuration against production OPC UA
systems — add certificate-based auth, encryption, and input validation first.
