# OPC UA MCP — Test Suite

Three tiers, fastest first. Pick the narrowest one that covers your change.

| Tier | Directory | Needs | Time | What it is for |
|------|-----------|-------|------|----------------|
| **unit** | `unit/` | nothing | <1s | Pure logic: ISO-8601 parsing, contract invariants, version manifests |
| **e2e** | `e2e/` | mock OPC UA server + built Node server | ~50s | Drives both real servers over stdio via the `mcp` client SDK |
| **smoke** | `smoke/` | npm + uv | ~20s | Builds and installs the real npm tarball and Python wheel, then drives the *installed* entry points |

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest unit/         # fast inner loop
uv run --no-sync pytest               # unit + e2e (smoke is deselected by default)
uv run --no-sync pytest -m smoke smoke/
```

The Node server has its own unit tests, run separately:

```bash
cd packages/server-node && npm run build && npm test
```

**Why the smoke tier exists:** everything else runs from the source tree, where
relative paths happen to resolve and dependencies come from `uv.lock`. Users get
a tarball or a wheel. That gap has shipped real bugs — a wheel that raised
`FileNotFoundError` on import, and an unbounded `mcp` dependency that resolved to
a breaking major on any fresh install. Both were invisible to the e2e suite.

## What the e2e tier covers

Every test runs against **both** server implementations.

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `test_lists_core_tools` | All 7 core tools are advertised |
| `test_history_tool_exposed_when_supported` | History tool appears because the mock enables history |
| `test_aggregate_tool_hidden_when_unsupported` | Aggregate tool is **hidden** (mock advertises no aggregate functions) — capability gating |
| `test_aggregate_tool_exposed_when_supported` | Aggregate tool **appears** against the aggregate-capable mock |
| `test_aggregate_average_values_are_correct` | `Average` over a known ramp advances by exactly one interval per bucket |
| `test_aggregate_default_end_time_is_utc` | Omitting `end_time` does not overshoot the window on a non-UTC host (#24) |
| `test_aggregate_rejects_unknown_function` | An unsupported aggregate name is rejected, listing what the server offers |
| `test_read_single_node` | `read_opcua_node` returns a value |
| `test_read_multiple_nodes` | `read_multiple_opcua_nodes` returns all requested nodes |
| `test_get_all_variables` | `get_all_variables` discovers the address space |
| `test_browse_children` | `browse_opcua_node_children` lists the four folders |
| `test_write_numeric_node` | Writing a `Double` actuator succeeds |
| `test_write_boolean_node` | Writing a `Boolean` node with `"true"` succeeds (bool-handling regression) |
| `test_call_method_start_then_stop` | `call_opcua_method` drives `StartProduction`/`StopProduction` and `SystemMode` reacts |
| `test_read_history` | The history tool (`read_history_opcua_node`) returns timestamped records |

Both servers expose the history tool under the same name, `read_history_opcua_node`,
and only when the server advertises `AccessHistoryDataCapability`.

## Mock servers

Two are used, on purpose:

| Mock | Port | Role |
|------|------|------|
| `packages/mock-server` (python-opcua) | 4840 | Industrial address space, history, methods. Advertises **no** aggregate functions — this is what makes the capability-gating assertions meaningful. |
| `packages/mock-server-aggregate` (node-opcua) | 4841 | Advertises aggregate functions and genuinely implements `ReadProcessedDetails`. Ramps `Temperature` (`ns=1;i=1001`) by +1.0/second so aggregates are verifiable arithmetically. |

The main mock cannot serve aggregates even in principle: python-opcua answers
`ReadProcessedDetails` with `BadNotImplemented`.

## Prerequisites

- `uv`, `node` (>=18), `npm`
- Set up the workspace once (from the repo root): `uv sync --all-packages`
- Build the Node server once: `cd packages/server-node && npm install && npm run build`
  (Node tests are **skipped** if `build/index.js` is missing).
- Install the aggregate mock once: `cd packages/mock-server-aggregate && npm install`
  (aggregate tests are **skipped** if its `node_modules` is missing).

## Running

```bash
cd tests
uv run --no-sync pytest -v
```

`pytest` runs the unit and e2e tiers; smoke is deselected by default via
`addopts = "-ra -m 'not smoke'"` because it builds and installs packages.

The suite reuses mock OPC UA servers already listening on `:4840` (the main mock)
and `:4841` (the aggregate-capable mock); if none is running it starts them for
the session (and waits a few seconds for history to accumulate). To force
specific endpoints:

```bash
OPCUA_SERVER_URL="opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/" uv run --no-sync pytest -v
OPCUA_AGGREGATE_SERVER_URL="opc.tcp://localhost:4841/UA/Aggregate" uv run --no-sync pytest -v
```

Select a single implementation:

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest -v -k "[python]"
uv run --no-sync pytest -v -k "[node]"
```

The brackets matter: they match the parametrisation id. A plain `-k node` would
also match test *names* like `test_read_opcua_node`.

## Notes

- The mock server's method callbacks update internal state; OPC UA node values
  are propagated by its 1 Hz simulation loop, so tests poll (see
  `wait_for_node_value`) rather than reading immediately after a method call.
- Writes to sensor/actuator nodes may be overwritten within ~1s by the
  simulation loop; only the command variables (`StartProductionCommand`, …) and
  methods persist.
