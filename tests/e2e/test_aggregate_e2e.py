"""End-to-end tests for `read_aggregate_opcua_node` on both MCP servers.

These run against the aggregate-capable mock (`packages/mock-server-aggregate`,
:4841) rather than the main mock, which deliberately advertises no aggregate
functions. The negative case — the tool staying hidden when the server cannot
support it — lives in ``test_mcp_e2e.py`` and runs against the main mock.

The mock ramps its Temperature node at a known rate, so aggregate output is
checked arithmetically rather than merely for non-emptiness: with a +1.0/second
ramp, consecutive Average buckets must differ by exactly the processing interval
expressed in seconds.

Run:
    cd tests && uv run pytest -v e2e/test_aggregate_e2e.py
