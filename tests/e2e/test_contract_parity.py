"""Contract-parity tests: both MCP servers must agree with contract/tools.json.

The Node server builds its tools/list directly from the contract; the Python
server sources its tool descriptions and capability node IDs from it. This test
asserts that, against the mock server, BOTH servers advertise exactly the
contract's applicable tools, with matching descriptions and parameter sets, and
that what they actually return matches the contract's declared ``resultShape`` —
so the two implementations cannot silently drift.

Run as part of the normal suite:
    uv sync --all-packages && cd tests && uv run --no-sync pytest -v
